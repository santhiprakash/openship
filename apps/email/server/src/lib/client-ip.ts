/**
 * Resolve the calling client's IP address for rate-limiting / audit logging.
 *
 * Openship's deploy topology always fronts this Bun process with
 * openresty/nginx inside the orchestrator stack. The reverse proxy
 * populates `X-Real-IP` with the originating client address and
 * strips/rewrites anything inbound. We trust that header at face
 * value and ignore `X-Forwarded-For` entirely.
 *
 * If we ever lose the proxy (direct exposure) the function returns
 * the socket-level remote (or "unknown"), so rate limiters still
 * have a bucket — but that path should never happen in production.
