/**
 * CacheStore<T> — pluggable TTL cache abstraction.
 *
 * Two interchangeable backends:
 *
 *   "redis"   Shared across replicas via Redis SETEX + SCAN. Used when
 *             REDIS_URL is reachable. Survives process restart, keeps
 *             multi-replica deployments consistent.
 *
 *   "memory"  Process-local TtlCache wrapper. Used as the fallback for
 *             self-hosted / desktop / dev. Loses state on restart,
 *             which is fine for token/installation caches that
 *             self-heal via cache-miss → re-fetch.
 *
 * Every caller (GitHub token cache, future session caches, etc.) talks
 * to the interface — none knows which backend is live. The probe +
 * selection happens once at first `createCacheStore` call, mirroring
 * the job-runner module pattern.
 *
 * Keys are namespaced by the `namespace` arg at create time so two
 * unrelated caches (github tokens, oauth sessions) cannot collide on
 * shared Redis. Memory mode uses one TtlCache per namespace.
