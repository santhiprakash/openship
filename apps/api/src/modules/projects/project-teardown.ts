/**
 * Atomic project teardown.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "delete this project, everywhere, or fail
 * loud". Replaces the legacy soft-delete-after-best-effort-cleanup flow
 * in project-cleanup.service. Two-phase:
 *
 *   1. Gate. `getActiveProjectState` lists deployments / build sessions /
 *      backup runs / restores still in flight. The route refuses (409)
 *      unless `force=true`, in which case we cancel each and wait briefly
 *      for confirmed quiescence.
 *   2. Sequence. Every named step runs inside its own try/catch and
 *      reports {step, status, details?, error?} so the caller can render
 *      partial-success states. The DB row only hard-deletes after the
 *      remote/runtime steps run — but the row drop itself is its own step
 *      too, so a successful row drop with one stuck external resource
 *      still returns 207 with that step marked `failed` in the response.
 *
 * The teardown sequence is INTENTIONALLY ordered:
 *   webhook → runtime resources → webmail → DB row.
 * GitHub first because once the row is gone we lose `webhookId`. Runtime
 * resources next because the existing manifest reads container/volume
 * metadata from `deployment`+`service` rows that the FK CASCADE will
 * later drop. Webmail (filesystem branding + mail-state block) runs
 * before the DB drop so a partial failure still leaves the project
 * resolvable in the dashboard. The DB hard-delete is last, and FK
 * ON DELETE CASCADE on `project.id` (deployment, service, env_var,
 * domain, backup_policy) does the dependent-row sweep in one statement.
