/**
 * Project service - barrel re-export.
 *
 * All logic has been split into focused service files:
 *   - project-crud.service.ts      → CRUD, ensure, git, options, deployments
 *   - project-env.service.ts       → environment variables
 *   - project-resources.service.ts → resources, sleep mode
 *   - project-runtime.service.ts   → logs, enable/disable
 *   - project-cleanup.service.ts   → delete orchestrator
 *
 * This barrel preserves the original import surface so that
 * `import * as projectService from "./project.service"` continues to work.
